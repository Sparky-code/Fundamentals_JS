            // Learn about the Call Stack, mechanism to track function calls

            // manages *execution contexts* - global execution contexts and function execution contexts
            // works on LIFO 'Last In First Out'
            
            // when executing a script, JS engine creates a global execution context and pushes it to the top of the call stakc.

            // when a function is called, JS creates a function exectuion context and pushes it to the top of the call stack > starts executing the function

            // when functions call other functions, JS creates a NEW function execution context for the funciton that is being called and pushes it to the top of the call stack

            // when the function completes, JS pops it off the stack and continues execution where it left off in the last code lsiting

            // Script stops when call stack is empty

            // Example
            /*

            function add(a, b) {
                return a + b;
            }

            function average(a, b) {
                return add(a, b) / 2;
            }

            let x = average(10, 20);

            // main is set up() > x calls average > average calls add > add is processed and removed > average is processed and removed > stack is empty > script finishes

            */

            // stack overflow
            // stack has a fixed size, depending on the implementation of the host env. --> either web browser or node.js

            // if number of executions exceeds the stack size, stack overflow occurs

            // Ex --> a recursive function with no exit condition

            function foo() {
                foo();
            }

            foo(); // Stack overflow

            // Javascript is a single thread programming language. 
            // only one call stack, only one thing at a time
            // code executes top to bottom, line by line = synchronous

            // Asynchronous is opposite of this..happening concurrently
            // JS implements 'event loops' to deal with callbacks, promises, and async/wait . cover later
