        /* Notes and sample scripts */

        // Problem solving is the core of what a developer does
        // Def: writing original programs that perform a particular set of task
        // and meet all stated constraints. - V. Anton Spraul (Think like a programmer)

        // Best way to build this skill is producing a lot of programs
        // PRACTICE!

        // Steps in problem solving
        // explain psuedo code and its use
        // Break down problems into subproblems

        // Explain 
          // Understand the problem, write it down in plain english, draw diagrams, etc - so that it makes sense
        
        // Plan 
          // What steps are or goals are you going to need to solve?

          // Is there a UI? what does it look like? functionality? Sketch it!
          // What inputs are needed? will the user enter data or will you draw it from another source?
          // What is the desired output? what do you want to present?
          // What are the steps that need to be taken to get the desired output from the given inputs.
    
        //Psuedo Code
          // write the recipe for building the algorithm

          // Take the time to slow down and work out the logic of your algorithm in plain language
          // Once the logic is sorted out, moving to code and finding the appropriate functions and interactions will be smoother
        
        // Divide & Conquer
          // Pick the small and simple subproblems and build from there.
            // Simple means you already know the answer (or are close), after that simple
            // means the problem is independent of others being solved
          // Its ok to not know all the steps, building an incomplete algo is fine
          // this will make bridging the steps that are unknown easier
            //connect the dots to arrive at the big solution
          // Don't start with the big problem!
          

        // Example - FizzBuzz
        // Explain
          // write a program that prints number from 1 to the input value
          // for multiples of 3 print 'fizz' instead of the number
          // for multiples of 5 print 'buzz' instead of the number
          // for multiples of both print 'fizzbuzz' instead of the number

          // Plan
            // interface? Command line program
            // input? user input from command line
            // output? desired output is:
              // list of numbers from 1 to input
              // numbers divis by 3, replace with fizz
              // numbers divis by 5, replace with buzz
              // numbers divis by both, replace with fizzbuzz

          // Pseudo Code
            // user inputs a number
            // loop from 1 to entered number
            // if current num is divis by 3 then print 'Fizz'
            // if current num is divis by 5 then print 'Buzz'
            // if current num is visis by both then print 'FizzBuzz'
            // otherwise print current number

          // Divide & Conquer

          /*

        let answer = parseInt(prompt('Please enter your FizzBuzz number'));

        for (let i = 1; i <= answer; i++) {
            if (i % 3 ===0 && i % 5 === 0) { // must come first otherwise program will check valid for a single # and move on.
                console.log('FizzBuzz');
            } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
                console.log('Buzz');
            } else if (i % 3 === 0){
                console.log('Fizz');
            } else {
                console.log(i);
            }
        }
